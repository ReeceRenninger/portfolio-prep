## Professional Pitch
Hello, my name is Reece Renninger. I am a highly motivated and dedicated individual with a wealth of experience and education under my belt. I proudly served in the United States Marine Corps, where I learned the values of discipline, hard work, and commitment to service.
After completing my service, I decided to pursue my passion for psychology and earned a degree from California State University Long Beach. I have always been interested in understanding people's needs and developing effective solutions to help them, which is why psychology was a perfect fit for me.
I am now focused on becoming a full stack  JavaScript Developer. I am determined to expand my knowledge in this field and apply my expertise to create innovative solutions to everyday problems. With my exceptional work ethic, resilience, and passion for continuous learning, I am confident that I can make a significant impact in the tech industry.
If you are looking for a team player who is always ready to take on new challenges, then I am the perfect candidate for your team. 


## What excites me about tech
The world of tech is limitless.  It is an ever expanding and evolving career field that has new ideas and projects that could make potentially huge changes to the world.  Tech can change the world with advanced robotics, or improve on how we develop software that tracks illegal activities on the web, or even improve the life of a person who is bound to a wheelchair and how they communicate with their loved ones.  Technology is only limited by someone's ability to imagine.
